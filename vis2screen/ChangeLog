DiFX-1.5.2
~~~~~~~~~~
Added plotDiFX.py and diffDiFX.py for comparing DiFX output files directly in a "dumb" manner, and started this ChangeLog.  
Previously, printDiFX and RPFitsReader were available for dumping some data to screen in order to inspect output files.
Made Makefile.am a bit more useful, although it still doesn't compile RPFitsReader by default, since the rpfits libraries
might not be available
