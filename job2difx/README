job2difx installs in a way that should be familiar to most that have installed
modern Gnu software.

Requirements:

package difxio (available at the same place you got this package) is required
in order to compile the calcif2 component of this package.

To install from a .tar.gz distribution:

tar zxvf job2difx-XXX.tar.gz
cd job2difx-XXX
./configure --prefix=<prefix>     (replace <prefix> with the base install dir)
make
# (maybe become root here)
make install


To install from a fresh svn checkout, run the following:

aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake -a

./configure --prefix=${DIFX_PREFIX}
make
# (su root?)
make install

After an svn update, these steps do not need to be rerun.  usually just 
"make" will update everything properly, but sometimes it is necessary
to run "autoreconf" before compiling again.  If that doesn't work,
one can always fall back on the above sequence of commands.

To run calcif, environment variable CALC_SERVER needs to be set to
the name of the computer running calcserver.
